Virtual_Keyboard_openCV

This project is about using openCV and mediapipe libraries to utilize the webcamera for writing in real time.

The main idea is:

1)detect hands using mediapipe.

2)detect index and thumb fingers' tip locations.

3)if only index is over one of the keys change the transparency of the key.

4)if both index and middle fingers are over a key add the letter of the key to the written text.
